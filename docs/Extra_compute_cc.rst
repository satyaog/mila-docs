Compute Canada Clusters
=======================

The clusters named `Beluga`, `Cedar`, `Graham`, `Narval` and `Niagara` are
clusters provided by the `Compute Canada organisation
<https://www.computecanada.ca>`_. For Mila researchers, these clusters are to
be used for larger experiments having many jobs, multi-node computation and/or
multi-GPU jobs as well as long running jobs.


Current allocation description
------------------------------

Clusters of Compute Canada are shared with researchers across the country.
Allocations are given by Compute Canada to selected research groups to ensure
to a minimal amount of computational resources throughout the year.

Depending on your affiliation, you will have access to different allocations. If
you are a student at University of Montreal, you can have access to the
``rrg-bengioy-ad`` allocation described below. For students from other
universities, you should ask your advisor to know which allocations you could
have access to.

From Compute Canada's documentation: `An allocation is an amount of
resources that a research group can target for use for a period of
time, usually a year.` To be clear, it is not a maximal amount of
resources that can be used simultaneously, it is a weighting factor of
the workload manager to balance jobs.  For instance, even though we
are allocated 400 GPU-years across all clusters, we can use more or less than
400 GPUs simultaneously depending on the history of usage from our
group and other groups using the cluster at a given period of time.
Please see Compute Canada's `documentation
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Allocations_and_resource_scheduling>`__
for more information on how allocations and resource scheduling are
configured for these installations.

.. Il est possiblement dangeureux de donner le nom de compte de Yoshua sur un
   site publiquement disponible.

The table below provides information on the allocation for
``rrg-bengioy-ad`` for the period which spans from April 2022 to
April 2023. Note that there are no special allocations for GPUs on
Graham and therefore jobs with GPUs should be submitted with the
account ``def-bengioy``.

Account Creation
----------------

To access the Compute Canada (CC) clusters you have to first create an account
at https://ccdb.computecanada.ca. Use a password with at least 8 characters,
mixed case letters, digits and special characters. Later you will be asked to
create another password with those rules, and it’s really convenient that the
two password are the same.

Then, you have to apply for a ``role`` at
https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/me/add_role, which basically means telling CC that
you are part of the lab so they know which cluster you can have access to, and
track your usage.

You will be asked for the CCRI (See screenshot below). Please reach out to your
sponsor to get the CCRI.

.. image:: role.png

    :alt: role.png

You will need to **wait** for your sponsor to accept before being able to login
to the CC clusters.


Clusters
--------

Beluga:
   (:ref:`Mila doc <beluga>`)
   (`Compute Canada doc <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/B%C3%A9luga/en>`__)

   For most students, Beluga is the best choice for both CPU and GPU jobs because
   of larger allocations on this cluster.
Graham:
   (:ref:`Mila doc <graham>`)
   (`Compute Canada doc <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Graham/en>`__)

   Graham has recent T4 GPUs. It can be a good alternative to Beluga with similar characteristics.
Cedar:
   (:ref:`Mila doc <cedar>`)
   (`Compute Canada doc <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar/en>`__)

   Cedar is a good alternative to Beluga if you absolutely need to have an internet connection
   on the compute nodes.
Niagara:
   (:ref:`Mila doc <niagara>`)
   (`Compute Canada doc <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Niagara/en>`__)

   We do not have allocations on Niagara anymore but it remains a good alternative for CPU jobs.


Beluga
^^^^^^

Beluga is a cluster located at `ÉTS <https://www.etsmtl.ca/>`_ in Montreal. It
uses SLURM to schedule jobs. Its full documentation can be found `here
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Béluga/en>`__, and its current status `here
<http://status.computecanada.ca>`__.

You can access Beluga via ssh:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh <user>@beluga.computecanada.ca

Where ``<user>`` is the username you created previously (see `Account Creation`_).


Launching Jobs
""""""""""""""

Users must specify the resource allocation Group Name using the flag
``--account=rrg-bengioy-ad``.  To launch a CPU-only job:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sbatch --time=1:0:0 --account=rrg-bengioy-ad job.sh

.. note::

   The account name will differ based on your affiliation.

To launch a GPU job:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sbatch --time=1:0:0 --account=rrg-bengioy-ad --gres=gpu:1 job.sh

And to get an interactive session, use the ``salloc`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ salloc --time=1:0:0 --account=rrg-bengioy-ad --gres=gpu:1

The full documentation for jobs launching on Beluga can be found `here
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Running_jobs>`__.


Beluga nodes description
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Each GPU node consists of:

* 40 CPU cores
* 186 GB RAM
* 4 GPU NVIDIA V100 (16GB)

.. tip:: You should ask for max 10 CPU cores and 32 GB of RAM per GPU you are
   requesting (as explained `here
   <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Allocations_and_resource_scheduling>`__),
   otherwise, your job will count for more than 1 allocation, and will take
   more time to get scheduled.


.. _cc_storage:


Beluga Storage
""""""""""""""

================== ==================== =========================
Storage            Path                 Usage
================== ==================== =========================
``$HOME``          /home/<user>/        * Code
                                        * Specific libraries
``$HOME/projects`` /project/rpp-bengioy * Compressed raw datasets
``$SCRATCH``       /scratch/<user>      * Processed datasets
                                        * Experimental results
                                        * Logs of experiments
``$SLURM_TMPDIR``                       * Temporary job results
================== ==================== =========================

They are roughly listed in order of increasing performance and optimized for
different uses:

* The ``$HOME`` folder on NFS is appropriate for codes and libraries which are
  small and read once. **Do not write experiemental results here!**
* The ``$HOME/projects`` folder should only contain **compressed raw** datasets
  (**processed** datasets should go in ``$SCRATCH``). We have a limit on the
  size and number of file in ``$HOME/projects``, so do not put anything else
  there.  If you add a new dataset there (make sure it is readable by every
  member of the group using ``chgrp -R rpp-bengioy <dataset>``).
* The ``$SCRATCH`` space can be used for short term storage. It has good
  performance and large quotas, but is purged regularly (every file that has
  not been used in the last 3 months gets deleted, but you receive an email
  before this happens).
* ``$SLURM_TMPDIR`` points to the local disk of the node on which a job is
  running. It should be used to copy the data on the node at the beginning of
  the job and write intermediate checkpoints. This folder is cleared after each
  job.

When an experiment is finished, results should be transferred back to Mila
servers.

More details on storage can be found `here
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/B%C3%A9luga/en#Storage>`__.


Modules
"""""""

Many software, such as Python or MATLAB are already compiled and available on
Beluga through the ``module`` command and its subcommands. Its full
documentation can be found `here
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Utiliser_des_modules/en>`__.

====================== =====================================
module avail           Displays all the available modules
module load <module>   Loads <module>
module spider <module> Shows specific details about <module>
====================== =====================================

In particular, if you with to use ``Python 3.6`` you can simply do:

.. code-block:: console

   $ module load python/3.6

.. tip:: If you wish to use Python on the cluster, we strongly encourage you to
   read `CC Python Documentation <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Python>`_,
   and in particular the `Pytorch <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/PyTorch>`_
   and/or `Tensorflow <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/TensorFlow>`_ pages.

The cluster has many Python packages (or ``wheels``), such already compiled for
the cluster. See `here <https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Python/en>`__ for the
details. In particular, you can browse the packages by doing:

.. code-block:: console

   $ avail_wheels <wheel>

Such wheels can be installed using pip. Moreover, the most efficient way to use
modules on the cluster is to `build your environnement inside your job
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Python#Creating_virtual_environments_inside_of_your_jobs>`_.
See the script example below.


Script Example
""""""""""""""

Here is a ``sbatch`` script that follows good practices on Beluga:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --account=rrg-bengioy-ad         # Yoshua pays for your job
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=6                # Ask for 6 CPUs
    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1                     # Ask for 1 GPU
    #SBATCH --mem=32G                        # Ask for 32 GB of RAM
    #SBATCH --time=3:00:00                   # The job will run for 3 hours
    #SBATCH -o /scratch/<user>/slurm-%j.out  # Write the log in $SCRATCH

    # 1. Create your environement locally
    module load python/3.6
    virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env
    source $SLURM_TMPDIR/env/bin/activate
    pip install --no-index torch torchvision

    # 2. Copy your dataset on the compute node
    # IMPORTANT: Your dataset must be compressed in one single file (zip, hdf5, ...)!!!
    cp $SCRATCH/<dataset.zip> $SLURM_TMPDIR

    # 3. Eventually unzip your dataset
    unzip $SLURM_TMPDIR/<dataset.zip> -d $SLURM_TMPDIR

    # 4. Launch your job, tell it to save the model in $SLURM_TMPDIR
    #    and look for the dataset into $SLURM_TMPDIR
    python main.py --path $SLURM_TMPDIR --data_path $SLURM_TMPDIR

    # 5. Copy whatever you want to save on $SCRATCH
    cp $SLURM_TMPDIR/<to_save> $SCRATCH


Using CometML and Wandb
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The compute nodes for Beluga don't have access to the internet,
but there is a special module that can be loaded in order to allow
training scripts to access some specific servers, which includes
the necessary servers for using CometML and Wandb ("Weights and Biases").

.. code-block:: console

   $ module load httpproxy

More documentation about this can be found `here
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Weights_%26_Biases_(wandb)>`__.


Graham
^^^^^^

Graham is a cluster located at University of Waterloo. It uses SLURM to schedule
jobs. Its full documentation can be found `here
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Graham/>`__, and its current status `here
<http://status.computecanada.ca>`__.

You can access Graham via ssh:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh <user>@graham.computecanada.ca

Where ``<user>`` is the username you created previously (see `Account Creation`_).

Since its structure is similar to `Beluga`, please look at the `Beluga`_
documentation, as well as relevant parts of the `Compute Canada Documentation
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Graham>`__.

.. note:: For GPU jobs the ressource allocation Group Name is the same as Beluga, so you should use the flag ``--account=rrg-bengioy-ad`` for GPU jobs.


Cedar
^^^^^

Cedar is a cluster located at Simon Fraser University. It uses SLURM to schedule
jobs. Its full documentation can be found `here
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar>`__, and its current status `here
<http://status.computecanada.ca>`__.

You can access Cedar via ssh:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh <user>@cedar.computecanada.ca

Where ``<user>`` is the username you created previously (see `Account Creation`_).

Since its structure is similar to `Beluga`, please look at the `Beluga`_
documentation, as well as relevant parts of the `Compute Canada Documentation
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar>`__.

.. note:: However, we don't have any CPU priority on Cedar, in this case you can
  use ``--account=def-bengioy`` for CPU. Thus, it might take some time before
  they start.


Niagara
^^^^^^^

Niagara is a cluster located at University of Toronto. It uses SLURM to schedule
jobs. Its full documentation can be found `here
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Niagara>`__, and its current status `here
<http://status.computecanada.ca>`__.

You can access Niagara via ssh:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh <user>@niagara.computecanada.ca

Where ``<user>`` is the username you created previously (see `Account Creation`_).

Since its structure is similar to `Beluga`, please look at the `Beluga`_
documentation, as well as relevant parts of the `Compute Canada Documentation
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Niagara_Quickstart>`__.


FAQ

What to do with  `ImportError: /lib64/libm.so.6: version GLIBC_2.23 not found`?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The structure of the file system is different than a classical Linux, so your
code has trouble finding libraries. See `how to install binary packages
<https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Installing_software_in_your_home_directory#Installing_binary_packages>`_.

Disk quota exceeded error on ``/project`` file systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have files in ``/project`` with the wrong permissions. See `how to change
permissions
