Data Sharing Policies
=====================

`/miniscratch <Information.html#storage>`_ supports ACL to allows collaborative
work on rapidly changing data, i.g. work in process datasets, model
checkpoints, etc...

`/network/projects <Information.html#storage>`_ aims to offer a collaborative
space for long-term projects. Data that should be kept for a longer period then
90 days can be stored in that location but first a request to `Mila's helpdesk
<https://it-support.mila.quebec>`_ has to be made.
